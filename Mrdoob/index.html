				<h5>An interview with Mr.doob</h5>

			<em>Ricardo Cabello, aka Mr.doob, is a self-taught web developer based in London (he originally hails from Barcelona). He kindly agreed to answer a few questions via email. His website can be found <a href="http://mrdoob.com/">here</a>.</em>

			<p><strong>Why do you choose to go by Mr.doob instead of your real name, and where does that name come from?</strong></p>
			<p>While working at this company in London I used to wear headphones while working. On IM I would set my name as "do_ob" and different variations of it reflecting my mood. At some point someone greeted me as "Hello Mr.doob!". The name stuck and as it seemed easier to pronounce then "Ricardo" I went with it.</p>

			<p><strong>When did you start using the internet, and what did you use it for?</strong></p>
			<p>This makes me feel old. There was a thing called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> [bulletin board system] before the internet existed. I started connecting to those to, hmm...download anime images and demos [Mr.doob was very active in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> subculture]. That was in the early 90s.</p>  

			<p><strong>Mr.doob has made dozens of demos and visualizations. Here are five of them:</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/solitaire/">Winning Solitaire</li>
					<li><a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/depth_of_field/">Depth of Field</li>
					<li><a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-sphere/">Google Sphere</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://xplsv.com/prods/demos/xplsv_orsotheysay/">Or so they say...</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/ie6/">Internet Explorer 6</a></li>
				</ol>

			<p><strong>From what I understand, you used to be a designer but are now more of a developer. Why did you decide to make that transition?</strong></p>
			<p>I felt I was able to help more people coding than designing. So far I think that's the case. :)</p>

			<p><strong>Why did you create <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a>, and what are some of the most exciting or unexpected uses of three.js you've come across?</strong></p>
			<p>I created it [in 2010] because I needed it. HTML5 needed it. And turns out many other needed it. I think that <a href="http://vr.chromeexperiments.com/">VR</a> is quite an exciting use for the library but the most unexpected so far may be this company called <a href="https://www.leiainc.com/">LEIA</a>, which is using it for authoring content for their holographic screens. Seeing Microsoft and Apple using it on their websites is also unexpected.</p>

			<p><strong>How did you get involved with Google and projects like <a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/">The Wilderness Downtown</a> and <a href="http://www.ro.me/">3 Dreams of Black</a>? What was it like to work with such a large team of people on those two projects?</strong></p>
			<p>Being at the right place at the right time I guess. I started collaborating with Aaron Koblin and Chris Milk on this <a href="http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/">project for Johnny Cash</a>. After that we did "The Wilderness Downtown" and after that "3 Dreams of Black". The latter was quite a big team, it was challenging but it was also the most fun I've had on a project until now.</p> 

			<p><strong>Do you consider yourself to be part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement">open source movement</a>, and if so, what do you think are some of the best things that have come out of it?</strong></p>
			<p>I don't think I would call it a "movement". But, you know...Linux, Chrome and Android are pretty remarkable open source projects.</p>
