				<h2>Sergei Parajanov &amp; Dod Abashidze<br> Georgia, 1988</h2>

				<div class="text_wrap">
					<p>While my year began with heartbreak and confusion, it didn’t end like that. Smiled upon by the grace of fate’s toothy face, I met a wonderful, enchanting woman with a keen sense of the absurd and a giddy taste for cinematic adventure. I knew I was smitten when we spent an elated evening on her couch watching Sergei Parajanov’s bewildering love story, <em>Ashik Kerib,</em> over a bottle of wine. <em>Ashik Kerib</em>, like Parajanov’s other work, is elliptical, mysterious, and ecstatically consumed by the ritualism of its visual symbols. Ostensibly a story about a poor minstrel who is prohibited from marrying the daughter of a wealthy merchant until he makes good, <em>Ashik Kerib</em> is really about rugs and swans and pomegranates and tiger costumes and the color red and mustaches and endless dancing. I loved this movie as much as I loved the romance of watching it, of laughing and losing myself and turning around to be astonished anew by Parajanov’s visionary cinematography. I haven’t stopped smiling since.</p>

							<p>“As far away as is possible from the immersive, sympathetic humanism of Puiu’s earlier <em>The Death of Mr. Lazarescu</em>, <em>Aurora</em> refuses any easy access. For three hours we follow the mundane preparations for a series of murders, but with the precise motivation and the nature of the protagonist’s relationships kept consistently unclear (although it is all resolved in retrospect at the end—perhaps too much so).” <strong>Continue&nbsp;reading&nbsp;&#8594;</strong></p>

						<a href="http://notcoming.com/2013/08_liberame.php">
							<p>“<em>Libera me</em> is composed as a series of tableaux, each an achingly precise image: a slab of meat tied up with string; makeshift coffins numbered with black paint; a handkerchief; a bundle of bedding; a head doused with blood. No words are spoken, but the soundtrack is rich with the faint sounds of bodies breathing, moving, writhing, touching. Its low-key lighting and palette of dim blues and greys and browns give it an eerily outdated look that is virtually impossible to associate with the early 1990s.” <strong>Continue&nbsp;reading&nbsp;&#8594;</strong></p>

In believing their daughters to be handicapped – and, more importantly, treating them like a lost cause – they effectively ensured that the girls would be.” <strong>Continue&nbsp;reading&nbsp;&#8594;</strong></p>
