<p><code>This neighborhood was designed for
the wretched dignity of the petty bourgeoisie,
for respectable occupations and intellectual
tourism. The sedentary population of the
upper floors was sheltered from the influences
of the street. </code></p>

<p><code>It was the external setting of our story, where a few people put into practice
a systematic questioning of all the works and
diversions of a society, a total critique of its
notion of happiness.</code></p>

<p><code>These people also scorned "subjective profundity."
The only thing that interested them was
a satisfactory concrete expression of their own
lives.</code></p>

<p>Human beings are not fully conscious
of their real lives. Groping in the dark, overwhelmed
by the consequences of their acts, at
every moment groups and individuals find
themselves faced with outcomes they had not
intended.</p>

<p><code>They said that oblivion was their ruling 
passion. They wanted to reinvent everything
each day; to become the masters of their own
lives.</code></p>

<p><code>Just as we do not judge an individual by what he
thinks about himself, we cannot judge such a
period of transformation by its own consciousness.
On the contrary, this consciousness must
be understood as reflecting the contradictions of
material life, the conflict between social conditions
and the forces of social production.</code></p>

<p><code>Knowledge of empirical facts remains abstract
and superficial as long as it is not concretized
by being related to the whole situation. This is
the only method that enables us to supersede
partial and abstract problems and get to their
<em>concrete essence</em> and thus implicitly to their
meaning.</code></p> 

<p><code>This group lived on the margins of the economy.
It tended toward a role of pure consumption,
particularly the free consumption of its
own <sub>time</sub>. It thus found itself directly involved
in qualitative divergences from ordinary life,
but deprived of any means to influence those
divergences.</code></p>

<p>There was the fatigue and the cold of

<p>The era had attained a level of knowledge
and technologies that made possible, and increasingly necessary, a <em>direct</em> construction of
all the aspects of a mentally and materially
liberated way of life. The appearance of these
superior means of action, though they remained
unused because of the delays in the
project of abolishing the commodity economy,
had already revealed the obsolescence of all
aesthetic activity, whose ambitions and powers
had both dwindled away. The decay of art and
of all the old codes of conduct had fanned
our sociological background.</p>

<p>The ruling class's monopoly on the instruments we needed in
order to implement the collective art of our
<sub>time</sub> had left us completely outside the official
cultural production, which was devoted to
illustrating and repeating the past. An art film
on this generation can only be a film about its
lack of real creations.</p>

<p>Others unthinkingly followed the paths
learned once and for all, to their work and their
home, to their predictable future. For them
duty had already become a habit, and habit a
duty. They did not see the deficiency of their
city. They thought the deficiency of their life was natural.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of a few places gave us intimations

would be necessary to create in order to provide
the setting for less mediocre games. We could

animated.</p>

<p><em>There are now people who pride
themselves on being authors of films, as others
were authors of novels. They are even more
backward than the novelists because they are
unaware of the decomposition and exhaustion
of individual expression in our <sub>time</sub>, unaware
that the arts of passivity are over and done.
They are sometimes praised for their sincerity
since they dramatize with more personal depth
the conventions of which their life consists.
There is talk about "liberating the cinema." But
what does it matter to us if one more art is
liberated to the point that Tom, Dick or Harry
can use it to complacently express their servile
sentiments? The only interesting venture is the
liberation of everyday life, not only in a historical
perspective, but for us, right now. This
project implies the withering away of all the
alienated forms of comtnunication. The cinema,
too, must be destroyed.</em></p>
